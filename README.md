# _Stephanie Spears' Track Selector_

#### _Webpage for Epicodus (Week 2 Solo-Project), January th, 2017_

#### By _**Stephanie Spears**_

## Description

  _**This project was created for Epicodus to fulfill the following objectives:**_

_Create a Track Suggester webpage (using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JQuery) that asks students a series of questions about themselves and provides a track suggestion based on their answers. You can ask questions about the languages themselves, the kinds of environments where these languages are used, or anything else you find relevant._

_Ruby/Rails_
_PHP/Drupal_
_Java/Android_
_CSS/Design_
_C#/.NET_

_Include a minimum of 5 survey questions._
_Offer a minimum of 3 different track suggestions (you are not required to include every track, see note below)._
_Don't forget regular Git commits and a detailed README. Commit messages should always be on-topic and professional in tone._
_Note: You are not required to take every possible combination of answers into account. Feel free to use very simple logic, or even ignore the user's responses for some questions._

_Further Exploration_
_If you finish the objectives with time to spare, consider adding additional features such as:_

_Ask the user for their name and address them directly in all of the responses to them: "Enrique, you ought to study Java, so you can learn how to make mobile apps for Android!"._
_Make questions multiple choice (like a, b, or c); determine which track is right for a user by identifying the letter that was most frequently selected; for example, "You chose mostly a's, you should definitely study C#!"._
_Use fade in/out or slide in/out jQuery Effects throughout your project._
_Objectives_
_Your code will be reviewed for the following objectives:_

_All previous standards (last week's independent project objectives) are in place (see below)._
_Site uses branching to return the result._
_jQuery is used to show and hide the result after questions are answered and submitted._
_Form gathers input from the user._
_Variable names are descriptive of what they represent._
_Web page is styled using Bootstrap and custom CSS._
_The project is in a presentable, portfolio-quality state._
